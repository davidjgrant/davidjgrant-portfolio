The score ranges from 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest) and the aim is to rank as high as possible so that you reach the pinacle of being Number #1. As you can’t rank yourself you must invest in creating an outstanding profile. When a player taps on your card, it expands to show your profile and they can then see our most recent check in, your bio and a gallery of photos.

If you are interested or have any further questions about how this app works because believe me, I’ve thought long and hard about it, then contact me so we can chat about how twisted this is.
